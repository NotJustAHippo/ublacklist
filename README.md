# List of sites I block with ublacklist.

*ublacklist* is a great extension that makes it easy to prevent domains from
showing up in Google search results. 

Most searches on Google now bring up an array of worthless SEO spam sites. 
With *ublacklist* you can ensure you never see them again. 

Google used to offer this as a feature for Search, but it was discontinued 
many years ago but *ublacklist* brings it back.

Please suggest new enteries via Pull requests.
